# Frankenphp Websocket WASM Kanban

This is a demo project to build a WebSocket/WASM server in PHP using FrankenPHP.

To run this project, you must either use frankenphp in docker or use the frankenphp static binary.

```bash
cd [root_path_of_project]
frankenphp run
```

The root project path is the folder where the Caddyfile lives.
